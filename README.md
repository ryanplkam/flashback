##Flashback: *Relive the magic of travel*

Flashback is a responsive travel diary app built by Ryan Kam and Cuong Tran over the course of 3 days for their Lighthouse Labs midterm project. Inspired by a deep conviction that there must be a better way to relive travel memories than flipping through Facebook photo albums, Flashback allows users to commemorate their special memories within an elegant, modern, and fully-responsive UI.

## Description

# Trips and Activities

Trips are the core of the Flashback experience. From South America backpacking to Asia ecotouring to a traditional European escapade, trips are what we most strongly associate with those magical travel memories. In Flashback, trips are represented in card format, making it easy to quickly see key trip information such as the trip location, date, and duration.

If trips are structures, activities are the individual bricks they are composed of. Activities naturally belong to trips, and are typically shorter-lived and more discrete experiences -- such as a sightseeing cruise on the Seine, for example. No travel experience is complete without a collection of Instagram-able photos, which is why users can upload photos to activity-specific albums. A select photo from one of a trip's albums will also be chosen as the trip 'cover photo'.
